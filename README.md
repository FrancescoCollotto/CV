# Francesco Collotto

I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer**, I started my journey with the fundamentals of programming through self-directed learning and I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp learning best practices and agile methodologies. I want to bring my passion and dedication into my first role in tech.
