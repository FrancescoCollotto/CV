I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer**, I started my journey with the fundamentals of programming through self-directed learning and I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp learning best practices and agile methodologies. I want to bring my passion and dedication into my first role in tech.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Nov '21 - Feb '22)
- Learned how to implement full CRUD web applications using different programming languages and frameworks
- Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- Applied OOP (Object-Orient-Programming) principles and TDD (Test-Driven-Development) to create modular, flexible and reusable software
- Learned to code with: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, SQL databases
- Testing frameworks: RSpec, Jest

#### Courses (2020 - 2021)
I first started learning the basics of computer programming in various online resources and books such as:
- *freeCodeCamp.org*, taught the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript
- *Udemy*, completed 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' by Colt Steele, learned using NodeJS with Express and MongoDB
- *'Eloquent Javascript'* book by Marjin Haverbeke, a more deep introduction to the complexity of Javascript language

#### University of Florence, Italy (2007 - 2011)

- BA Art, Music, Theater and Cinema studies

## Work Experience

**Simpsons Tavern** (2012 - 2021)  
_Bartender/Waiter_

- I have been a proud team member of one of the oldest restaurant in London, working both behind the bar and serving tables
- I worked alongside amazing colleagues to deliver the best possible customer experience
- I learned to work under stressful condition to ensure a smooth running restaurant

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
During the four months at Makers Academy I was faced with many new technical challenges that always bring new problems, I always applied a rigourous analytical process, second to my nature, to find the right solution to any struggle by carefully read any error messages(always celebrate error messages!!) and using debugging techniques taught during the course.

#### Open-Mindedness


#### Team Player
In my previous career in the catering industry I worked in a small team of five individuals, taking care of more than hundred customers in only 2 hours during busy lunch time in the City of London. This was possible thanks to group members sharing the same common goals, having clear and direct communication and focusing on problem solving rather than expending energy on competitive struggles or interpersonal issues.

## Hobbies

I love cooking and I am currently mastering sourdough baking, when I am not coding you will find me outside walking, hiking, snowboarding or playing football with friends.
